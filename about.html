  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    Hi, I’m <strong>Prajwal H S</strong>, a software developer with a strong interest
    in building clean, maintainable systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    I primarily work on Android applications and enjoy understanding problems deeply
    before jumping into solutions. I like systems that are simple, scalable, and
    easy for other developers to reason about.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of software, I’m a cyclist and a hobbyist artist. Cycling has taught me
    patience, consistency, and endurance — qualities that translate surprisingly
    well into software engineering.
  </p>

  <p>
    This website is my personal space to document my work, thoughts, and learnings.
